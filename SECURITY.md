# Security Policy
This is the current Security Policy for QuickLock. Last updated on February 22th, 2022.

## About
This is the guideline for reporting security vulnerabilities. If you have found one it is very important you report it as soon as possible before any malicious intents get to any other people.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a new vulnerability, please create a new issue using the **Security Vulnerability** template. Click [here](https://github.com/LiteTools/QuickLock/issues) to go to the Issues Tab.

### Notice
Even though QuickLock is more of a "local" application and does not have a public API or database yet, there can still be vulnerabilites within our code (Example: A feature that can exploit Windows features for malicious purposes.)
